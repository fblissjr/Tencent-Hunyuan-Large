## Model Introduction

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific tasks. However, as the scale of these models increases, optimizing resource consumption while maintaining high performance has become a key challenge. To address this challenge, we have explored Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. The currently unveiled Hunyuan-Large (Hunyuan-MoE-A52B) model is the largest open-source Transformer-based MoE model in the industry, featuring a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion active parameters. This is currently the largest open-source Transformer-based MoE model in the industry, featuring a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion active parameters. 

By open-sourcing the Hunyuan-Large model and revealing related technical details, we hope to inspire more researchers with innovative ideas and collectively advance the progress and application of AI technology. We welcome you to join our open-source community to explore and optimize future AI models together!
 
### Introduction to Technical Advantages

#### Model
- **High-Quality Synthetic Data**: By enhancing training with synthetic data, Hunyuan-Large can learn richer representations, handle long-context inputs, and generalize better to unseen data.

- **KV Cache Compression**: Utilizes Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Cross-Layer Attention (CLA) strategies to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead of KV caches, improving inference throughput.

- **Expert-Specific Learning Rate Scaling**: Sets different learning rates for different experts to ensure each sub-model effectively learns from the data and contributes to overall performance.

- **Long-Context Processing Capability**: The pre-trained model supports text sequences up to 256K, and the Instruct model supports up to 128K, significantly enhancing the ability to handle long-context tasks.

- **Extensive Benchmarking**: Conducts extensive experiments across various languages and tasks to validate the practical effectiveness and safety of Hunyuan-Large.

#### Inference Framework
- This open-source release offers two inference backend options tailored for the Hunyuan-Large model: the popular [vLLM-backend](https://github.com/quinnrong94/vllm/tree/dev_hunyuan) and the TensorRT-LLM Backend. Both solutions include optimizations for enhanced performance. For instance, the introduction of a new CLA structure significantly reduces GPU memory usage, achieving a 50% savings in the KV-Cache portion, which ensures efficient handling of long text scenarios. Additionally, by employing FP8 quantization, we achieve a 50% reduction in memory usage compared to traditional FP16/BF16 quantization, while maintaining precision and resulting in a 70% increase in throughput. Meanwhile, by leveraging the efficient operators at the core of TRT-LLM, the performance of the TRT-LLM solution surpasses that of vLLM by over 30%. The TRT-LLM solution is widely used in Tencent's Hunyuan project. In this release, we are initially open-sourcing the vLLM solution, with plans to release the TRT-LLM solution in the near future.

#### Training Framework

- The Hunyuan-Large open-source model is fully compatible with the Hugging Face format, enabling researchers and developers to perform model fine-tuning using the hf-deepspeed framework. Additionally, we support training acceleration through the use of flash attention. To further assist in the adoption process, we have made the corresponding training scripts and model implementations publicly available to the community through this release, facilitating subsequent model training and fine-tuning operations based on these resources.

## Data

Hunyuan-Large provides model training-related processes. In this section, you can process the training data format for use in model training.

### Training Data Format and Processing

Training data is processed into a messages format as follows. The default system prompt for training and inference is "You are a helpful assistant." Below are examples of single-turn and multi-turn data:


```python
# Single-Turn Data Format

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "海水为什么是咸的" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "海水是咸的主要是因为其中含有许多溶解在水中的盐类和矿物质。这些盐类和矿物质来自于地球表面的岩石和土壤中的化学物质，随着时间的推移，它们被带到了海洋中。当海水蒸发时，水分蒸发掉了，但盐类和矿物质仍然留在水中，导致海水变得更加咸味。因此，海水的咸度是由其中的盐类和矿物质的含量决定的。"}
]

# Multi-Turn Data Format
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "知道重庆森林这部电影吗？" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "知道呀，是一部由王家卫导演的片子。" },
    {"role": "user", "content": " 而主演里更是有王菲，一上映便受到追捧。" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "所以此片获得了第14届香港电影金像奖最佳影片奖。"}
]

from tokenizers import ByteLevelBPETokenizer
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./models", use_fast=False, trust_remote_code=True)

ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages)

```



For more usage references, see the `./models/test.py` file.

&nbsp;

## Quick Start

You can quickly get started by referring to the content in the <a href="examples/README.md">Quick Start Guide</a>.

## Model Training

To simplify the Training process, HunyuanLLM provides a pre-built Docker image:

 [hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large/general). 

### Hardware Requirements

Tested on H20, without enabling `make_moe_param_leaf_module` and using `zero3+offload`, with a `max_seq_length` of 2048, full fine-tuning requires at least 32 GPUs, and LoRA fine-tuning requires at least 8 GPUs.

### Training Performance

With the minimum configuration (8 GPUs for LoRA fine-tuning), `per_device_train_batch_size` is set to 1, and `gradient_accumulation_steps` is set to 1, resulting in approximately 35 seconds per iteration.

### Launch Method

Refer to: [HuggingFace Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.19.2/en/main_classes/trainer)

#### Single-Machine Training

In the `train` directory, execute:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash train.sh
```

#### Multi-Machine Training

To start training on multiple machines, follow the steps below and ensure that all machines are within the same cluster.

##### Configure Passwordless SSH Login Between Machines

The following steps use two machines as an example, with their IPs represented as `${ip1}` and `${ip2}`. These operations are performed within a Docker container.

First, configure passwordless SSH between containers on each machine.


```sh
ssh-keygen			# Generate id_rsa and id_rsa.pub for passwordless login
ssh-keygen -t rsa -A    # Generate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key and ssh_host_ecdsa_key for starting 'SSH listen' later
/usr/sbin/sshd -p 36005 -o ListenAddress=0.0.0.0        # Start SSH listen
echo "Port 36005" > ~/.ssh/config   # Change SSH connection port to 36005
passwd root    # Set root password to avoid alerts from monitoring platforms
```


Note: The `36005` here is an example. You can choose any port, but ensure that the port is **open** and **not occupied by other processes**.

Next, within the container on each machine, execute:

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

**Copy the output SSH public key and paste it into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file, with one public key per line. This must be done on every machine.** Ultimately, the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on each machine should be identical and contain the public keys of all machines.

It's important to note that during multi-node training, the code executed on each node must be consistent. It is recommended to mount a shared network drive. If mounting a shared drive is not possible, you need to manually copy the dataset, scripts, and code to the same directory on all machines.

##### Start Multi-Machine Training

Once the preparation steps are completed and dependencies are confirmed to be installed (if not, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install), you can add the following configuration at the beginning of `train.sh`:

```shell
export HOST_GPU_NUM=8
# Current machine IP
export LOCAL_IP=${ip1}
# Multi-node machine IPs, separated by commas
export NODE_IP_LIST="${ip1}:8,${ip2}:8"
# Number of machine nodes
export NODES=2
export NODE_NUM=$((${NODES} * ${HOST_GPU_NUM}))
```

Note: Replace `${ip1}` and `${ip2}` with the actual IP addresses!

Then, on the machine with `${ip1}`, execute `bash train.sh` in the `train/` directory. Note that on the first run, you might see the following output:

```ssh
The authenticity of host '[ip]:36005 ([ip]:36005)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is xxxxxx.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:xxxxxx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

At this point, type `yes` to continue.

##### Key Parameters

The key parameters in the script are as follows:

- `--deepspeed`: This parameter should point to a DeepSpeed configuration file. The `train` folder provides three default DeepSpeed configuration files: `ds_zero2_no_offload.json`, `ds_zero3_no_offload.json`, `ds_zero3_offload.json`. The required GPU memory decreases in this order.
- `--model_name_or_path`: The path to the HF pre-trained model. Ensure this path contains the `modeling_hunyuan.py` and `configuration_hunyuan.py` files; otherwise, it cannot be loaded.
- `--tokenizer_name_or_path`: The path to the tokenizer folder. Ensure this path contains the `tokenization_hy.py` file; otherwise, it cannot be loaded.
- `--train_data_file`: The path to the training file, which should be a JSONL file.
- `--output_dir`: The output directory where logs, tensorboard files, and model weights will be stored.
- `--per_device_train_batch_size`: The batch size per GPU.
- `--gradient_accumulation_steps`: The number of gradient accumulation steps. The global batch size is `per_device_train_batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps * dp_size`.
- `--max_steps`: The total number of training steps.
- `--save_steps`: The number of steps between saving checkpoints.
- `--use_lora`: Whether to use LoRA for training. This also accepts `--lora_rank`, `--lora_alpha`, and `--lora_dropout` parameters. LoRA is applied by default to the 'q_proj', 'k_proj', 'v_proj', 'o_proj' parameters. If you need to change this, modify it in the code. Note: **When using LoRA for training, only the LoRA weights are saved, not the base model weights**. If you need to merge LoRA weights, see the "LoRA Weight Merging" section below.
- `--make_moe_param_leaf_module`: When using zero3 and MoE training, treat the MoE module as a leaf module, meaning its parameters are not split by zero3. This option is expected to significantly increase memory usage.
- `--gradient_checkpointing`: Enable gradient checkpointing.
- `--train_attention_params_only`: Whether to train only the attention parameters.
- `--learning_rate`: The maximum learning rate during training.
- `--min_lr`: The minimum learning rate during training.
- `--use_flash_attn`: 开启 flash-attention 进行训练加速

**Note:**

- If you want to continue training from a previously saved checkpoint instead of loading pre-trained weights, specify `--resume_from_checkpoint` with the path to the checkpoint from the previous training. Do not specify `--model_name_or_path`, as this will only load the weights and not the training state.
- When continuing training from a checkpoint, there might be slight deviations in loss due to randomness introduced by some non-deterministic algorithms, which is considered normal. Refer to: [HuggingFace Transformers Trainer Randomness](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/perf_train_gpu_one#randomness)
- When `--model_name_or_path` is specified, all model-related parameters will be ignored.
- Samples within a batch will be padded to align with the longest sample in the batch, with each sample having a maximum length of `max_seq_length`. Any excess will be truncated.
- If you encounter warnings about bias weights not being loaded, you can ignore them, as biases are not used in Hunyuan-Large.


#### What to Do If Out of Memory?

Refer to: [DeepSpeed Configuration](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/)

You can try modifying the DeepSpeed configuration by removing the auto attribute from these parameters and reducing their values:

- `stage3_param_persistence_threshold`
- `stage3_prefetch_bucket_size`
- `stage3_max_reuse_distance`
- `stage3_max_reuse_distance`

#### Merging LoRA Models

The saved LoRA weights cannot be merged into the zero3 model during training because, with zero3 enabled, model weights are split across different data parallel ranks. If you want to merge LoRA weights into the base model, you can do so offline to obtain the merged weight file. Execute `merge_lora_weight.sh` to merge the LoRA weights with the base model weights. The parameters include:

- `--base_model_path`: Directory of the base model weights
- `--adapter_model_path`: Directory of the LoRA weights
- `--output_path`: Directory to save the merged weights
- `--save_dtype`: Data format for storing the merged weights, available options include: fp16, bf16, fp32

## Inference and Deployment

HunyuanLLM uses TRT-LLM and vLLM for deployment. We are open sourcing the [vLLM-backend](https://github.com/quinnrong94/vllm/tree/dev_hunyuan) deployment (see Reasoning with vLLM), and the TRT-LLM deployment (see Reasoning with TRT-LLM) will be available in the near future.

## Using TRT-LLM for Inference

To be opened

## Using vLLM for Inference

### Docker:

To simplify the deployment process, HunyuanLLM provides a pre-built Docker image:

 [hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large/general). You only need to download the model files and start the Docker container using the code below to begin model inference.

```shell
docker run --name hunyuanLLM_infer -itd --privileged --user root --net=host --ipc=host --gpus=8 hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large:infer-open-source
```

Note: Docker container privilege management. The above code uses privileged mode (`--privileged`) to start the Docker container, which grants the container higher privileges, increasing the risk of data leakage and cluster security threats. It is recommended to avoid using privileged mode unless necessary to reduce security risks. For scenarios where privileged mode is required, conduct a thorough security assessment and implement appropriate security monitoring and hardening measures.

### Configure Passwordless SSH Login Between Machines

The following steps use two machines as an example, with their IPs represented as `${ip1}` and `${ip2}`. These operations are performed within a Docker container.

First, run `passwd` on both machines to set a password, for example: `Tmp123,./`

Copy `inference/login_ssh.py` into the container and execute the following command, ensuring the IP and password are correctly entered.

```shell
python3 login_ssh.py --ips ${ip1},${ip2} --port 36000 --password=Tmp123,./
```

**Note 📢: Before starting, be sure to verify multi-machine communication using VLLM's debugging script: https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/debugging.html**

### BF16 Deployment

BF16 requires 16 H20 GPUs for deployment. After verifying that multi-machine communication is correct, execute the following steps:

Before running the commands, set the following environment variables:

```shell
${LOCAL_IP}: The IP corresponding to bond1 on the current machine
${MODEL_PATH}: Path to the Hunyuan LLM model
```

#### Step 1: Start Ray

Ray is an open-source library for parallel and distributed Python. In this section, we use Ray to achieve multi-machine communication.

Ray Component Configuration Hardening: The default configuration of Ray components does not enable authentication mechanisms for service ports (e.g., 6379, 8265), posing risks of unauthorized access and command execution. It is recommended to deploy Ray components only in trusted internal network environments or ensure strict access control list (ACL) policies are implemented for these ports to prevent unauthorized network access.

First, start Ray on each node (either in the background or by keeping the terminal running):

On the head node:
```shell
export VLLM_HOST_IP=${LOCAL_IP}
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
ray start --block --head --node-ip-address=${LOCAL_IP} --port=6379
```

On all worker nodes:

Note: Replace `{HEAD NODE $LOCAL_IP}` with the actual `${LOCAL_IP}` of the head node.
```shell
export VLLM_HOST_IP=${LOCAL_IP}
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
ray start --block --address={HEAD NODE $LOCAL_IP}:6379 --node-ip-address=${LOCAL_IP}
```
If Ray fails to start, execute `ray stop` and then run the above commands again.

#### Step 2: Execute Inference

#### Method 1: Command Line Inference

Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to quickly request the chat model using `vLLM`:

Note: vLLM Component Remote Code Execution Protection. In the code below, if the `trust-remote-code` configuration option of the vLLM component is enabled, it will allow loading and executing code from remote model repositories, which may lead to the execution of malicious code. Unless explicitly required by business needs, it is recommended to keep this configuration option disabled to reduce potential security threats.

```python
import os
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

model_path=os.environ.get('MODEL_PATH')

llm = LLM(model=model_path,
        tokenizer=model_path,
        trust_remote_code=True,
        max_model_len=10240,
        dtype='bfloat16',
        tensor_parallel_size=16,
        pipeline_parallel_size=1,
        disable_log_stats=False,
        gpu_memory_utilization=0.98,
        disable_custom_all_reduce=True,
        #distributed_executor_backend='ray',
        enforce_eager=True,
        max_num_seqs=8,
        use_v2_block_manager=True,
        quantization=None)

prompts = ["海水为什么是咸的"]

sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.7, top_p=0.6, max_tokens=200, top_k=20, repetition_penalty=1.05)

outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

# Print the outputs.
for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
```

#### Method 2: Service-Based Inference

Below we demonstrate how to deploy the model using `vLLM` in a service-based manner and make requests.

Run the following on the head node:

```shell
export VLLM_HOST_IP=${LOCAL_IP}
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
```

Next, start the service by running:

```shell
cd inference
sh run_server.sh
```

*Tips*: Troubleshooting, if you encounter the following error:

```python
ray.exceptions.RaySystemError: System error: No module named 'transformers_modules' traceback: Traceback (most recent call last):
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers_modules'
```

Copy the `~/.cache/huggingface/modules/` directory from the head node to the corresponding path on all worker nodes.

After successfully running `run_server.sh`, execute the request script:

```shell
sh openapi.sh
```

Be sure to modify `${LOCAL_IP}` and `${MODEL_PATH}` in `openapi.sh` to values match the corresponding service.


### Quantized Model Deployment:

This section describes the process of deploying a quantized model using vLLM.

Image: The deployment image is the same as for BF16.

#### Int8 Quantized Model Deployment:

To deploy the Int8-weight-only version of the Hunyuan-L model, simply set the environment variables in `run_server_int8.sh`:

```shell
${MODEL_PATH}: Path to the BF16 model
${LOCAL_IP}: The IP corresponding to bond1 on the current machine
```

Then, start the Int8 service by running:

```shell
sh run_server_int8.sh
```

After successfully running `run_server_int8.sh`, execute the request script:

```shell
sh openapi.sh
```

#### FP8 Quantized Model Deployment:

To deploy the W8A8C8 version of the Hunyuan-L model, simply set the environment variables in `run_server_fp8.sh`:

```shell
${MODEL_PATH}: Path to the FP8 model
${LOCAL_IP}: The IP corresponding to bond1 on the current machine
```

Then, start the FP8 service by running:

```shell
sh run_server_fp8.sh
```

After successfully running `run_server_fp8.sh`, execute the request script:

```shell
sh openapi.sh
```

#### FP8 BENCHMARK

This part introduces the Benchmark of Hunyuan Large Instruct FP8 quantitative model.

| Dataset | BF16 | W8A8C8-FP8 |
|---------|------|------------|
| ARC-C   | 94.6 | 94.2       |
| C-Eval  | 88.6 | 89.2       |
| CMMLU   | 90.4 | 89.8       |

### Inference Performance

This section presents the efficiency test results of deploying various models (original and quantized) using vLLM, including inference speed (tokens/s) under different batch sizes.

| Inference Framework | Model                                                                                                  | Number of GPUs (H20) | input_length | batch=1 | batch=4 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------ |---------|---------|
| vLLM                | Hunyuan-Large                                                                                              | 16                   | 2048         | 20.2    | 75.5    |
| vLLM                | Hunyuan-Large(int8 weight only)                                                                            | 8                    | 2048         | 19.3    | 73.6    |
| vLLM                | Hunyuan-Large(W8A8C8-FP8)                                                                                  | 8                    | 2048         | 19.8    | 74.9    |

## Tokenizer

The tokenizer used in the HunYuan-Large model balances compression rate and effectiveness, ensuring that embeddings are sufficiently trained. The vocabulary includes 100K tokens integrated from tiktoken. Additionally, we trained an extra 29K Chinese tokens using a large amount of high-quality Chinese training data to enhance the model's Chinese capabilities and the tokenizer's compression rate. Combined, our new tokenizer improves the compression rate compared to the LLaMA3 tokenizer, increasing from 2.78 characters/token to 3.13 characters/token.

## 数据

Hunyuan-Large提供了模型训练相关流程，您可以在此章节对训练数据格式进行处理以供模型训练使用。

### 训练数据格式及处理 

训练数据按照以下形式处理为messages格式，训练和推理的默认system prompt为"You are a helpful assistant."，以下分别为单轮数据和多轮数据样例：

```python
# 单轮数据格式
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "海水为什么是咸的" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "海水是咸的主要是因为其中含有许多溶解在水中的盐类和矿物质。这些盐类和矿物质来自于地球表面的岩石和土壤中的化学物质，随着时间的推移，它们被带到了海洋中。当海水蒸发时，水分蒸发掉了，但盐类和矿物质仍然留在水中，导致海水变得更加咸味。因此，海水的咸度是由其中的盐类和矿物质的含量决定的。"}
]

# 多轮数据格式
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "知道重庆森林这部电影吗？" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "知道呀，是一部由王家卫导演的片子。" },
    {"role": "user", "content": " 而主演里更是有王菲，一上映便受到追捧。" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "所以此片获得了第14届香港电影金像奖最佳影片奖。"}
]

from tokenizers import ByteLevelBPETokenizer
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./models", use_fast=False, trust_remote_code=True)

ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages)

```

更多调用参考参考`./models/test.py`文件。


&nbsp;

## 快速开始

您可以参照<a href="examples/README.md">快速开始文档</a>中的内容进行快速上手。

## 模型训练 

为了简化部署过程，HunyuanLLM提供了预构建docker镜像：
 [hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large/general) 。

### 硬件需求

经过在 H20 上测试，不开 make_moe_param_leaf_module 以及 zero3+offload，max_seq_length 为 2048，全量微调最少需要 32 卡，lora 微调最少需要 8 卡。

### 训练性能

最低配置（8 卡 lora 精调）测试下，per_device_train_batch_size 为 1，gradient_accumulation_steps 为 1，大约 35s 一个 iteration。

### 启动方式

参考：[HuggingFace Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.19.2/en/main_classes/trainer)

#### 单机启动训练

在`train`目录下，执行：

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash train.sh
```

#### 多机启动训练

如果要用多台机器启动训练，请按照以下步骤执行，并保证多台机器在一个集群内。

##### 配置机器间免密 ssh 登录

以下操作以两个机器为例，两台机器的 ip 分别以`${ip1}`和`${ip2}`标识，以下操作均在 docker container 内执行。

首先，配置多机container免密，在每台机器上执行。

```sh
ssh-keygen			# 生成id_rsa和id_rsa.pub，用于免密登录
ssh-keygen -t rsa -A    # 生成/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key和ssh_host_ecdsa_key， 用于后面启动ssh listen
/usr/sbin/sshd -p 36005 -o ListenAddress=0.0.0.0        # 启动Listen
echo "Port 36005" > ~/.ssh/config   # ssh 连接端口修改为 36005
passwd root    # 需要配置root密码，否则监测平台会报警
```

注意：这里的`36005`是一个示例端口，可以选用任意端口，但需要保证使用的端口**开放**且**不被其他的进程占用**。

接下来，在每台机器的 container 内，执行：

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

**将输出的 ssh 公钥复制并粘贴到`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`文件中，每行一个公钥，每台机器上都要做这个操作**。最终每台机器上的`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`文件内容应当是一致的，并且包含了所有机器的公钥。

需要注意，多节点训练时，每个节点上执行的代码都得一致，建议挂载一个共享的网络盘，如果无法挂载共享网盘，则需要手动将数据集、脚本、代码复制在多台机器的相同目录下。

##### 启动多机训练

在以上准备步骤准备好了之后，以及确认依赖已经安装完成（如未安装，请执行`pip install -r requirements.txt`安装），就可以在`train.sh`中的开头增加以下配置：

```shell
export HOST_GPU_NUM=8
# 当前机器ip
export LOCAL_IP=${ip1}
# 多节点机器ip，逗号隔开
export NODE_IP_LIST="${ip1}:8,${ip2}:8"
# 机器节点个数
export NODES=2
export NODE_NUM=$((${NODES} * ${HOST_GPU_NUM}))
```

注意：将以上的`${ip1}`和`${ip2}`替换为真实的 ip 地址！

然后，在`${ip1}`的机器上，在`train/`目录下，执行`bash train.sh`即可，注意第一次启动时可能会看见以下的输出：

```ssh
The authenticity of host '[ip]:36005 ([ip]:36005)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is xxxxxx.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:xxxxxx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

此时输入`yes`即可继续。

##### 关键参数

脚本中的关键参数如下：

- `--deepspeed`: 此参数应当指向一个 deepspeed 的配置文件，`train`文件夹下提供了三种 DeepSpeed 的默认配置文件：`ds_zero2_no_offload.json`, `ds_zero3_no_offload.json`, `ds_zero3_offload.json`，这三个配置文件所需显存依次减少
- `--model_name_or_path`: 要加载的 HF 预训练模型权重，确保这个路径下包含了 `modeling_hunyuan.py` 和 `configuration_hunyuan.py` 文件，否则无法加载
- `--tokenizer_name_or_path`: tokenizer 文件夹路径，确保这个路径下包含了`tokenization_hy.py` 文件，否则无法加载
- `--train_data_file`: 训练文件路径，应该为一个 jsonl 文件
- `--output_dir`: 输出文件夹，log、tensorboard 和权重都会存储在这个路径下
- `--per_device_train_batch_size`: 每张卡上的 batch size
- `--gradient_accumulation_steps`: 梯度累计次数，`per_device_train_batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps * dp_size`为 global_batch_size
- `--max_steps`: 训练的总步数
- `--save_steps`: 每多少个 step 存储一个 checkpoint
- `--use_lora`: 是否用 lora 训练，同时接收`--lora_rank`，`--lora_alpha`和`--lora_dropout`参数。lora 默认应用于 "q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj" 四个参数，如果需要改变的话在代码中修改即可。注意：**使用 lora 训练时，只会保存 lora 的权重，而不会保存 base 模型的权重**，如果需要合并 lora 权重，看下面的“Lora 权重合并”一节
- `--make_moe_param_leaf_module`：当用 zero3 以及 MoE 训练时，将 MoE 模块视作一个 leaf module，即它的参数不进行 zero3 切分，这个选项预计会显著增加显存占用
- `--gradient_checkpointing`：开启梯度重计算
- `--train_attention_params_only`: 是否只训练 attention 参数
- `--learning_rate`: 训练时的最大学习率
- `--min_lr`: 训练时的最小学习率
- `--use_flash_attn`: 开启 flash-attention 进行训练加速

**注意：**

- 如果想从一个中途保存的 ckpt 继续训练，而不是加载一个预训练的权重，直接指定`--resume_from_checkpoint`为之前训练保存的 ckpt 路径，不要指定`--model_name_or_path`，这样只会加载权重，而不会加载训练状态
- 从 ckpt 继续训练时，loss 可能会有微小的偏差，这是由一些非确定性算法带来的随机性，是正常现象。参考：[HuggingFace Transformers Trainer Randomness 
- 当 `--model_name_or_path` 有效时，所有模型相关的参数都会被忽略
- 一个 batch 内的样本会通过 padding 对齐 batch 内最长的样本，而每条样本的长度最长为 max_seq_length，超出的部分会被裁剪
- 如果报出 bias 权重没有 load 的 warning，忽略即可，Hunyuan-Large 中不会用到 bias

#### 显存不足怎么办？

参考：[DeepSpeed Configuration](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/)

可以尝试修改 ds config，去掉这几个参数的 auto 属性，改小试试看：

- `stage3_param_persistence_threshold`
- `stage3_prefetch_bucket_size`
- `stage3_max_reuse_distance`
- `stage3_max_reuse_distance`


#### Lora 模型合并

保存下来的 lora 权重没法在训练运行时合并到 zero3 模型中，因为 zero3 开启时模型权重会切分到各 dp rank 上。因此如果想把 lora 权重合并到 base 模型上，可以通过离线的方式合并后得到权重文件。执行`merge_lora_weight.sh`即可完成 lora 权重和 base 模型权重的合并，其中的参数有：

- `--base_model_path`：base 模型的权重目录
- `--adapter_model_path`：lora 权重目录
- `--output_path`：合并后的权重保存目录
- `--save_dtype`： 以什么数据格式存储合并后的权重，可选值：fp16，bf16，fp32

&nbsp;

## 推理和部署 

HunyuanLLM支持TRT-LLM和vLLM两种部署方式。本次我们开源vLLM部署方式(详见'使用vLLM推理'章节)，TRT-LLM部署方式(详见'使用TRT-LLM推理'章节)将在近期开放。

## 使用TRT-LLM推理
待开放

## 使用vLLM推理
### Docker:

为了简化部署过程，HunyuanLLM提供了预构建docker镜像：

 [hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large/general) 。您只需要下载模型文件并用下面代码启动docker即可开始推理模型。
```shell
docker run --name hunyuanLLM_infer -itd --privileged --user root  --net=host --ipc=host --gpus=8 hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large:infer-open-source
```

注: Docker容器权限管理。以上代码采用特权模式（--privileged）启动Docker容器会赋予容器较高的权限，增加数据泄露和集群安全风险。建议在非必要情况下避免使用特权模式，以降低安全威胁。对于必须使用特权模式的场景，应进行严格的安全评估，并实施相应的安全监控、加固措施。


### 配置机器间免密 ssh 登录

以下操作以两个机器为例，两台机器的 ip 分别以`${ip1}`和`${ip2}`标识，以下操作均在 docker container 内执行。

首先在两台机器上面运行：`passwd`设置密码，例如：`Tmp123,./`

将`inference/login_ssh.py`拷贝到容器中，执行如下命令，注意IP和密码填入正确值。

```shell
python3 login_ssh.py --ips ${ip1},${ip2} --port 36000 --password=Tmp123,./
```

**注意📢：在启动前请务必通过VLLM的多机验证脚本:https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/debugging.html**

### BF16部署

BF16需要16卡H20部署。验证多机通信无误后，按如下步骤执行：

运行命令前请先设置如下环境变量：

```shell
${LOCAL_IP}：当前机器bond1对应IP
${MODEL_PATH}：Hunyuan LLM模型路径
```

#### Step1：Ray启动

Ray 是一个并行和分布式 Python 的开源库，本章节我们采用Ray来实现多机通信。

Ray组件配置加固：Ray组件默认配置中服务端口（如6379、8265）未启用身份验证机制，存在未授权访问和命令执行的风险。建议在部署Ray组件时，仅在受信任的内部网络环境中进行，或确保对这些端口实施严格的访问控制列表（ACL）策略，禁止非授权网络访问。

首先我们在各个节点上启动ray（放在后台启动或者保持终端运行状态）:

主节点上：
```shell
export VLLM_HOST_IP=${LOCAL_IP}
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
ray start --block  --head --node-ip-address=${LOCAL_IP} --port=6379
```

所有子节点：

注意：{主节点$LOCAL_IP}需填入主节点的${LOCAL_IP}
```shell
export VLLM_HOST_IP=${LOCAL_IP}
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
ray start --block --address={主节点$LOCAL_IP}:6379  --node-ip-address=${LOCAL_IP} 
```
如果启动ray失败，执行`ray stop`后再次执行上述命令。


#### Step2：执行推理

#### 方式1：命令行推理

下面我们展示一个代码片段，采用`vLLM`快速请求chat model：

注: vLLM组件远程代码执行防护。下列代码中vLLM组件的trust-remote-code配置项若被启用，将允许加载并执行来自远程模型仓库的代码，这可能导致恶意代码的执行。除非业务需求明确要求，否则建议该配置项处于禁用状态，以降低潜在的安全威胁。


```python
import os
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

model_path=os.environ.get('MODEL_PATH')

llm = LLM(model=model_path,
        tokenizer=model_path,
        trust_remote_code=True,
        max_model_len=10240,
        dtype='bfloat16',
        tensor_parallel_size=16,
        pipeline_parallel_size=1,
        disable_log_stats=False,
        gpu_memory_utilization=0.98,
        disable_custom_all_reduce=True,
        #distributed_executor_backend='ray',
        enforce_eager=True,
        max_num_seqs=8,
        use_v2_block_manager=True,
        quantization=None)

prompts = ["海水为什么是咸的"]

sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.7, top_p=0.6, max_tokens=200, top_k=20, repetition_penalty=1.05)

outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

# Print the outputs.
for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")
```

#### 方式2：服务化推理

下面我们展示使用`vLLM`服务化的方式部署模型并请求

在主节点上运行：

```shell
export VLLM_HOST_IP=${LOCAL_IP}
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=bond1
```
接着我们启动服务，运行 :
```shell
cd inference
sh run_server.sh
```

*Tips*：故障处理，如果遇到
```python
ray, exceptions.RaySystemError: System error: No module named 'transformers_modules' traceback: Traceback (most recent call last):
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers modules'
```
将主节点上的 ~/.cache/huggingface/modules/拷贝到所有子节点相应路径。

运行`run_server.sh`成功后, 运行请求脚本：
```shell
sh openapi.sh
```

注意修改`openapi.sh`中的`${LOCAL_IP}`和`${MODEL_PATH}`为服务对应值。


### 量化模型部署：

本部分介绍采用vLLM部署量化后模型的流程。

镜像：部署镜像同BF16。


#### Int8量化模型部署：
部署Int8-weight-only版本Hunyuan-L模型只需设置`run_server_int8.sh`中的环境变量：
```SHELL
${MODEL_PATH} : BF16模型路径
${LOCAL_IP} : 当前机器bond1对应IP
```

接着我们启动Int8服务。运行：
```shell
sh run_server_int8.sh
```

运行`run_server_int8.sh`成功后, 运行请求脚本：
```shell
sh openapi.sh
```

#### FP8量化模型部署：
部署W8A8C8版本Hunyuan-L模型只需设置`run_server_int8.sh`中的环境变量：
```shell
${MODEL_PATH} : FP8模型路径
${LOCAL_IP} : 当前机器bond1对应IP
```

接着我们启动FP8服务。运行：
```shell
sh run_server_fp8.sh
```

运行`run_server_fp8.sh`成功后, 运行请求脚本：
```shell
sh openapi.sh
```

## Tokenizer

HunYuan-Large模型中采用的tokenizer平衡了压缩率和效果两个因素，保证embedding可以得到充分的训练。词表包含了从tiktoken中集成的100K个token，在此基础上，我们使用大量的优质中文训练数据，训练了额外的29K的中文token，以增强模型的中文能力和tokenizer对文本的压缩率，二者结合后，与LLaMA3分词器相比，我们的新分词器在压缩率上有所改善，从2.78个字符/token提高到3.13个字符/token。

""" HunYuan model configuration"""

from transformers.configuration_utils import PretrainedConfig
from transformers.utils import logging


logger = logging.get_logger(__name__)


class HunYuanConfig(PretrainedConfig):
    r"""
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`HunYuanModel`]. It is used to instantiate an
    HunYuan model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the HunYuan-7B.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32000):
            Vocabulary size of the HunYuan model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`HunYuanModel`]
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 4096):
            Dimension of the hidden representations.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 11008):
            Dimension of the MLP representations.
        num_hidden_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer decoder.
        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer decoder.
        num_key_value_heads (`int`, *optional*):
            This is the number of key_value heads that should be used to implement Grouped Query Attention. If
            `num_key_value_heads=num_attention_heads`, the model will use Multi Head Attention (MHA), if
            `num_key_value_heads=1 the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA) otherwise GQA is used. When
            converting a multi-head checkpoint to a GQA checkpoint, each group key and value head should be constructed
            by meanpooling all the original heads within that group. For more details checkout [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). If it is not specified, will default to
            `num_attention_heads`.
        hidden_act (`str` or `function`, *optional*, defaults to `"silu"`):
            The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the decoder.
        max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2048):
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with.
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        rms_norm_eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-06):
            The epsilon used by the rms normalization layers.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not the model should return the last key/values attentions (not used by all models). Only
            relevant if `config.is_decoder=True`.
        pad_token_id (`int`, *optional*):
            Padding token id.
        bos_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Beginning of stream token id.
        eos_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2):
            End of stream token id.
        pretraining_tp (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Experimental feature. Tensor parallelism rank used during pretraining. Please refer to [this
            document](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/parallelism) to understand more about it. This value is
            necessary to ensure exact reproducibility of the pretraining results. Please refer to [this
            issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/76232).
        tie_word_embeddings (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):

            The base period of the RoPE embeddings.
        rope_scaling (`Dict`, *optional*):
            Dictionary containing the scaling configuration for the RoPE embeddings. Currently supports two scaling
            strategies: linear and dynamic. Their scaling factor must be a float greater than 1. The expected format is
            `{"type": strategy name, "factor": scaling factor}`. When using this flag, don't update
            `max_position_embeddings` to the expected new maximum. See the following thread for more information on how
            these scaling strategies behave:
            https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14mrgpr/dynamically_scaled_rope_further_increases/. This is an
            experimental feature, subject to breaking API changes in future versions.
        attention_bias (`bool`, defaults to `False`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use a bias in the query, key, value and output projection layers during self-attention.

            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you provide
            it.

            Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
            [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

            [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
        attention_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

            [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

            Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
            [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

            If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `input_ids` have to be input (see
            `past_key_values`).

            If you want to change padding behavior, you should read [`modeling_opt._prepare_decoder_attention_mask`]
            and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) for more
            information on the default strategy.

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
        position_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0,
            config.n_positions - 1]`.

            [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
        past_key_values (`Cache` or `tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, *optional*):
            Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
            blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
            returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

            Two formats are allowed:
            - a [`~cache_utils.Cache`] instance;
            - Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of
            shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`). This is also known as the legacy
            cache format.

            The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input. If no `past_key_values` are passed, the
            legacy cache format will be returned.

            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `input_ids` (those that don't
            have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all `input_ids`
            of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
            is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
            model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
            `past_key_values`).
        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.

    The HunYuan Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).

    [`HunYuanForSequenceClassification`] uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models
    (e.g. GPT-2) do.

    Since it does classification on the last token, it requires to know the position of the last token. If a
    `pad_token_id` is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If
    no `pad_token_id` is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the
    padding tokens when `inputs_embeds` are passed instead of `input_ids`, it does the same (take the last value in
    each row of the batch).

# 实体抽取任务案例
为方便用户快速上手，下面我们准备了一个真实案例来演示如何使用`Hunyuan-Large`进行精调。
- 基座模型：`Hunyuan-Large-Instruct`
- 训练数据：约5k条汽车领域的[实体抽取数据](data)
- 训练数据示例如下
```
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "请提取下列文章中包含的车系：\n【恒升新迪比亚迪精诚服务】秦宋新能源车主爱车讲堂——春季公开课圆满结束\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "秦；宋新能源"}]}
```

## 训练部分
- 训练环境配置可参考 [train/README.md](../train/README.md)
- 训练脚本可参考 [train_demo.sh](train_demo.sh)，需要修改其中的`model_path`、`train_data_file`和`output_path`
- 首次加载模型耗时会较长，成功运行后会打印每个step的loss
